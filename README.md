## FireSafe is an application designed to keep individuals in high risk areas updated on fires. It also ensures that no individual gets left behind in the event of a forest fire eruption. FireSafe uses complex machine learning to locate secluded locations and homes, allowing responders to go down a checklist of locations and ensure individuals are all aware of fire threat and prepared to evacuate.
